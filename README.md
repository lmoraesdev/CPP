<p align=center>
CPP is the 12th project in the common core of the 42 ecole cursus. It introduces C++ and it's intended to be the student's first Object Oriented project.
Originally designed to be a mini piscine, CPP is composed of 9 modules that attempt to navigate through the most important concepts of Object Oriented programming while - hopefully - having some fun along the way.

The project

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 00 </summary>
	<p>The first Module of CPP works like every loving, carefull father when he first teaches his child how to swim: by promptly throwing them into the pool, no lifevest in sight. Pray there are no sharks in sight!</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 01 </summary>
	<p>The second module talks extensively about pointers, references and everything else you've already learned in C but seemed to have completely erased from your memory.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 02 </summary>
	<p>The third module is the begining of understanding what C++ is, and getting ourselves closer to the syntax, and lexical and analytical perks of it.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 03 </summary>
	<p>The fourth module is all about inheritance and all of its challenges and perks.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 04 </summary>
	<p>The fifth module takes a deeper dive into polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 05 </summary>
	<p>We're now officially closer to the end than at the beggining of our CPP journey. Now, we're diving deeper into error handling, exceptions and subclasses</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 06 </summary>
	<p>Now things start to get a little bit tense. The lists might be getting shorter, but do not be fooled!</p>
	<p>We're gonna be focusing on type casting, and a whole lot of thinking in a not-so-new low-level mentality. Keep going though, 'cause you're almost there. </p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 07 </summary>
	<p>Let's talk about templates! A simple, yet so powerfull tool</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 08 </summary>
	<p>Now we've finally reached containers! This module might look like a lot (and it is!) but it certainly takes your C++ knowledge to a whole new level.</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>CPP Module 09 </summary>
	<p>This is the big, cathartic moment we've all been waiting for. There's nothing particularly new about this list, except it's really freaking hard from the get go. The three exercises here are supposed to be fully functional programs, with very defined scopes. Let's dive into them one by one: this time, there's no use for a single wiki page, so I'm gonna do it differently: three README files, one in each of it's respective list's repositories.</p>
