Let the dance floor ignite as you move and groove, dance, dance, dance to the pulsating beat.
In the spotlight's embrace, let your body come alive, sway, spin, and dance, dance, dance with grace.
Feel the dance in your bones, surrender to the music's trance, and let your spirit freely dance, dance, dance.
From toe to heel, dance and let each step be a declaration of your passion, as you twirl, leap, and dance, dance, dance.
Unleash the fire within, let it consume you, as you surrender to the euphoria of the dance, dance floor.
You can dadance the night away.
dancedancedance till you have nothing to embrace
