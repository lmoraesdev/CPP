Description: What is a materia? A materia is a magical entity that can be used
to cast spells. It is a virtual class that will be inherited by concrete
classes that will implement the spells. The materia has a type, which is the
name of the spell, and a use function that will be implemented by the concrete
classes. The use function will receive a target as parameter, which will be the
character that will be the target of the spell.
